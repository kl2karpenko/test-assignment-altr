    - username/email input
    - submit button
- Home Page
  - show the name of application (choose the one you'd like)
  - some hello words 
  - header on the top, with 1 link to settings page and small icon LOGOUT
  - on click on settings we shoudl redirect user to the settings page
  - on click on logout we should logout user and redirect him to login page
- Settings page
  - Header: Settings Page
  - User info:
    - readonly input with his username/email
    - button LOGOUT

**Use cases, that should be covered:**

- When user is not logged in, when he enters a route he cannot enter, he will be redirected to /login page
- When user logged in, he will be redirected to HOME page

Create this small application using **TS/React/MaterialUI/NodeJS** and the DB you prefer.
